      <h3>Introducing... Violet Love</h3>
      <p>Hello! I'm Vi and thank you so much for stopping by my site! I'm a full stack developer with a specialization in developing accessible User Interfaces. I'm currently in Portland, Oregon, but will be moving to Seattle, Washington mid 2022, and perhaps earlier.</p>
      <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p> I've loved the Apple ecosystem since I was a teenager, and enjoy coding my own websites and apps in Swift using Xcode, I have a passion for beautiful and accessible design, and making tools and apps that work for everyone irregardless of their ability or background. I love working with others, apps and software generally come out better and more accessible with multiple minds and backgrounds working on it. I am strong supporter of pair programming. From experience it makes stronger engineers and better designed software. Some of my interests outside of software engineering are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Computer Games</li>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Podcasts</li>
        <li>Cats and Rats</li>
      </ul>
